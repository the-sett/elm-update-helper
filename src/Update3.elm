{-| Convenience function for lifting an update function for an inner model and
messages, that also returns an additional out parameters into a parent one.

    update : submsg -> submodel -> ( submodel, Cmd submsg, outmsg )

Into one that returns:

    (model, Cmd  msg, outmsg)

To have its model and out message evaluated in order to produce a new model,

passed in using Cmd.batch.
